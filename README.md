This is a work in progress, but check out my styling showcase project to get a look at my CSS skills here: [https://styling-showcase.vercel.app](https://styling-showcase.vercel.app/).

The designs come from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). All of the CSS is my own. 

The project is being built out with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
